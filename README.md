 Random-Password-Generator
 
 Description 
 
 I modified code for a random password generator application to give the user a random password after they answer several prompts 
 
 I wanted to prompt the user for several criteria for their password so that the password generated could be customizable 
 These prompts included asking for lowercase or uppercase as well as numbers and special characters 
 
 Once these prompts were answered the appilcation would present the user with the randomly generated password in the coresponding box. 
 
 Javascript was used to create this application 

If else statements are used to collect and validate user input and a for loop is used to generate the password length from the array created. 
Once a password is generated the user may click on the "generate button" to run the functions again and generate a new password based on new prompt ansers 

The user interface is basic however this allows ease of use and does not distract from the overall goal of the application
